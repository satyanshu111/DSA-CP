# All Nodes Distance K in BT

**Category:** Binary Trees  
**Platform:** LeetCode  
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/all-nodes-distance-k-in-binary-tree/

## Complexity
### Approach:- 
1. In binary tree we only have information about to move to its children 
2. So at first build parent map 
3. Then simple BFS to find all nodes at distance k 

- **Time:** O(NlogN)  
- **Space:** O(N)(Auxilary space)
